### Objective
Align the business website's positioning, messaging, and conversion flow with Mark Torres' personal consulting profile. Preserve credibility and depth from the personal site while retaining the business site's conversion-focused structure and offers.

---

### Personal Site — Core Messaging (What to Carry Over)

- Positioning: "I build machine learning systems that study social behavior online at scale."
- Expertise span: ML infrastructure, LLM-powered products, behavior-driven insights.
- Credibility: Leads engineering and ML for academic research at Northwestern; applied consulting across startups, product teams, labs, and civic orgs.
- Services:
  - LLM applications & AI agents (custom agents, retrieval, automation)
  - AI strategy & prototyping (scope high-leverage use cases, audits)
  - Recommendation & ranking systems (personalization, lead ranking)
  - ML infrastructure & pipelines (ingestion → inference)
- Proof examples (high-signal): lead qualifier; CRM sync agent; scheduling agent; copywriting; campaign analyzer; social content generator; AI avatar integrations.
- Engagement model: Most projects begin with a 1-week scoped sprint producing a working prototype/demo/system component.
- CTA: Email + Calendly booking.
- Tone/voice: Pragmatic, credible, shipping-focused ("Whatever moves the needle, I ship it.")

Implication: This profile provides depth and credibility that should anchor the business site's claims and examples.

---

### Business Site — Current Snapshot (What It Communicates)

- Hero: ROI-first framing: "Stop Losing $50,000+ Annually to Manual Tasks That AI Can Do Better" with trust stats (automation rate, savings, timeline) and guarantee.
- Offer structure: Pain-point tiles, library of AI agents (6 highlighted, 40+ referenced), process (3-step), testimonials, guarantee, lead capture (booking + ROI form).
- Social proof: Quantitative outcomes, selected logos, testimonial quotes.
- Conversion: Multiple CTA anchors to contact form and assessment, strong guarantee and urgency copy.

Strengths: Clear promise, strong CTA density, structured proof blocks, broad solution catalog. Risks: Some claims may appear overly generalized without grounding in Mark’s unique credibility; voice skews sales-first vs. expertise-led.

## Persona Evaluations

### 1) Product Marketing Expert

Findings

- Value Proposition Clarity: Strong ROI promise; missing Mark-specific differentiation (ML infrastructure + social behavior research + academic rigor). Add positioning that explains why outcomes are credible.
- Audience Alignment: Site speaks to SMBs and enterprise simultaneously. Consider segmenting paths (e.g., SMB automation vs. product/ML teams vs. research labs) with tailored proof.
- Competitive Positioning: Many agencies promise automation ROI; few have academic-scale social data + production ML infra background. Make this your wedge.
- Proof and Specificity: Quant claims are good; add methodology/context (ranges, sample sizes) and link to representative case write-ups for credibility.
- CTA Strategy: Maintain “Free Assessment” but add “Technical Deep Dive” option for engineering-led buyers and “1-week sprint kickoff” CTA for those ready to execute.

Recommendations

- Inject differentiators in hero subhead: "Applied ML + LLM systems, informed by large-scale social behavior research."
- Add a "Who I’ve helped" block mirroring the personal site segments and mini-examples.
- Create 3 segmented solution paths with tailored messaging and proof: SMB Ops Automation, Product/Engineering AI Integrations, Academic/Civic Research Systems.
- Add 2–3 concise case summaries with clear before/after, time-to-value, and data context; link to deeper write-ups.
- Calibrate guarantee copy with credibility markers (measurement plan, conditions) to feel rigorous, not hype.

---

### 2) MVP Landing Page Expert

Findings

- Conversion Flow: Strong CTA density and anchors. Consider a sticky CTA and a secondary CTA for technical readers (e.g., "View Architecture Examples").
- Information Hierarchy: Dense mid-page sections. Consider progressive disclosure: overview → segmented value → select 1–2 proof blocks → CTA → deeper details below.
- Trust Signals: Good quantity; increase quality by tying numbers to cases and logos to narratives.
- Friction: ROI form is helpful; consider adding Calendly embed for instant booking.
- Tracking: Ensure granular event tracking on all CTA clicks, form progression, and hero fold visibility.

Recommendations

- Above the Fold: Keep hero; tighten subcopy to 1 sentence. Add concise differentiator chip ("Northwestern ML research • Production AI systems").
- Sticky CTA: "Get Free Assessment" always visible on mobile/desktop.
- Form UX: Inline validation; success state; add Calendly embed below form for immediate scheduling.
- Performance: Optimize icon font use, compress images, preconnect fonts/CDN, ensure Core Web Vitals targets.

---

### 3) Brand Storytelling Expert

Findings

- Voice: Current site leans sales-heavy; personal site voice is expertise-forward, pragmatic, and credible.
- Narrative: Missing founder narrative that explains "why Mark" and connects to social behavior research + production results.
- Credibility Anchors: Under-leveraged academic leadership; add short bio + research background near the first CTA.
- Case Authenticity: Replace generic metrics with 2–3 real, attributed mini-cases (anonymous if needed) plus process transparency.

Recommendations

- Add a short founder section near top: 2–3 lines + headshot + Northwestern role + "Whatever moves the needle, I ship it."
- Create a concise "How I Work" section reflecting the 1‑week sprint model; link to delivery artifacts examples.
- Align testimonial tone with measurable outcomes and named roles; add logos tied to stories.
- Maintain confident tone but reduce scarcity/urgency copy; elevate expertise and process transparency.

---

## Gap Analysis: What to Add/Change

- Add: Mark-specific differentiators (social behavior research at scale, ML infra leadership, academic rigor) to hero subhead and About section.
- Add: Service taxonomy matching personal site (Agents, Strategy/Prototyping, Ranking/Recommendation, ML Infra).
- Add: "Who I’ve Helped" with examples from personal site; keep agent library but ground with real cases.
- Add: "How I Work" (1-week sprint) section above the process/guarantee.
- Revise: Guarantee language to include measurement criteria; move from pure hype to credible offer.
- Revise: Testimonials to include roles, companies, and specific outcome metrics; link to the related case.

---

## Content Mapping (Personal → Business)

- About/Founder
  - Bring over 2–3 sentence bio highlighting Northwestern role and applied consulting.
  - Include portrait/headshot and links (GitHub, Research) where appropriate.
- Services
  - Mirror the four service pillars; under each, link to 1 representative case or demo.
- Who I’ve Helped
  - Small business agents; SaaS integrations (voice/video AI avatars); product teams; academic labs; civic orgs.
- How I Work
  - 1-week sprint; deliverables (prototype/demo/system component or strategic recs).
- CTAs
  - Email + Calendly; keep Free Assessment + ROI Calculator; add "Technical Deep Dive" for engineering buyers.

- Add "How I Work" section and measurement criteria for guarantee.

Day 5 — QA, Performance, Launch

- Optimize assets and fonts; validate CWV; cross-device QA.
- Publish and monitor; schedule iteration checkpoints.

---

## Success Metrics

- Primary: Bookings (Calendly), Form submissions, Qualified calls held.
- Secondary: User engagement with case studies, demo requests.
- Guardrails: Core Web Vitals benchmarks, mobile responsiveness.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- Over-claiming without sourceable proof → Tie numbers to cases; add ranges and context.
- Message dilution across audiences → Segment paths early; personalize proof blocks.
- Performance regressions with richer content → Budget CWV; preconnect and compress; defer non-critical assets.
